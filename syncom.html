                    Set in a fantastical New York during the 20s,
                    you are the head of a growing mafia. At your disposal are your loyal hench-elves, dwarves and orcs. Send them
                    on missions against police forces or rival mafias to expand your territorial control. But beware, they the events
                    on the battlefield might affect their relationships, and they will grow to trust or hate each other. Recruit new
                    units with their own perks and personality, manage their sentiments to have the most efficient team, and gain control
                    of the city!
                </p>
                <p>
                    SynCOM a turn-based, tile-based tactical game in isometric view. Players will need to use almost-exclusively "Duo Abilities"
                    that perform differently depending of the relationship of the two units involved. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    SynCOM is my end of studies project. It is stil a work in progress, and is being developped in a team of 5 persons using Unity.
                    I'm working on the game design and programming of the emotion system.
